Winx Club is an Italian-American[a] animated television series created by Iginio Straffi and co-produced by Rainbow SpA and Nickelodeon.
Production on the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons was divided between Rainbow and Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
To attract an American audience, Viacom assembled a voice cast of Nickelodeon actors (including Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande), invested US$100 million in advertising for the series, and inducted Winx Club into Nickelodeon's franchise of Nicktoons.[5]Beginning in 2010, episodes of Winx Club have been jointly written with Nickelodeon's American team.
In 2019, Straffi commented on his near-decade of collaboration with Nickelodeon, saying that "the know-how of Rainbow and the know-how of Nickelodeon are very complementary; the sensibilities of the Americans, with our European touch."[6] The continued partnership between Rainbow and Nickelodeon on Winx Club has led to the development of additional co-productions, including Club 57 in 2019, on which much of Winx Club's staff worked.The series was subject to budget cuts in 2014, during its seventh season.
